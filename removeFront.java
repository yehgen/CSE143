// Write a method called removeFront that takes an integer n as a parameter and that removes the first n values from a list of integers. For example, if a variable called list stores this sequence:

//         [8, 17, 9, 24, 42, 3, 8]
// and the following call is made:

//         list.removeFront(4);
// then it should store the following values after the call:

//         [42, 3, 8]
// Notice that the first four values in the list have been removed and the other values appear in the same order as in the original list.

// You are writing a method for the ArrayIntList class discussed in lecture:

//         public class ArrayIntList {
//             private int[] elementData; // list of integers
//             private int size;          // current # of elements in the list

//             <methods>
//         }
// Your method should throw an IllegalArgumentException if the parameter n is less than 0 or greater than the number of elements in the list. You are not to call any other ArrayIntList methods to solve this problem, you are not allowed to define any auxiliary data structures (no array, ArrayList, etc), and your solution must run in O(n) time where n is the length of the list.

public void removeFront(int n) {
  if (n < 0 || n > size) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException();
  }
  
  for (int i = 0; i <= size - n; i++) {
    elementData[i] = elementData[i + n];
  }
  size = size - n;
}
